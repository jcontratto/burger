# Burger Node Express Handlebars


##  **Overview**

In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Used Node and MySQL to query and route data in my app, and Handlebars to generate my HTML. Used Heroku and JAWSdb for the data base. 
* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
